Explain the difference between `Relational Databases` and `SQL`.

A relational database is a set of formally described tables where data can be accessed or rearranged. SQL is the programming language/API used to work with said database.

Why do tables need a `primary key`?

A database table requires a primary key because it ensures accessiblity within the rows. Each table has one primary key, which can be built up by one or more columns. A primary key is a column within a table that serves a specific purpose. 

What is the name given to a table column that references the primary key on another table?

The name given to a table column that references another table's primary key is foreign key.

What do we need in order to have a _many to many_ relationship between two tables?

We need a join table (or intermediary table) to connect the relationships between two tables.
